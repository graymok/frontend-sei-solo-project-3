# Wrkpoint

## Overview
Wrkpoint is a full stack web application that enables users to browse and reserve available work spaces for the day. The application will leverage its own seeded set of work space data such as room names, seat capacities, and images.

Core features include user authentication, work space reservations, and the ability to filter available work spaces with search terms.

Stretch features include admin/utilization view and user workstyle assessment/recommendations.
